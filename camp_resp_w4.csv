I was not as enthusiastic about the idea of a park-and-ride facility in this area. If it is absolutely necessary, such a concept could be incorporated into the Ben Hill Station (that station could have a direct connection between the Interstate and a parking garage if desired). Greenbriar should be more focused on walking, cycling, and using transit. Its development should be better aligned with the city's long-term environmental goals.;There should also be limited parking so as to encourage the use of buses, light rail, and heavy rail.;['Greenbriar', 'Oakland City'];MARTA's existing heavy rail stations are largely underutilized, so developing a lot of mixed-use mid-rise development is key. Oakland City has the potential to be one of the most transit-rich nodes in Atlanta. Protected cycle lanes should be constructed along Campbellton Road, and the Oakland City Station should have sheltered and secured parking areas for bicycles, similar to facilities that are available in most train stations in the Netherlands.;I think MARTA's on the right track in pushing for a regional activity center around the Greenbriar Mall because there is so much surface parking that could be transformed into a densely-built mixed-use environment.;[];
