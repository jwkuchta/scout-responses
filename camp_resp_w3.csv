How will the transit vehicle look and feel?;;It would be wonderful to have transit that is light rail extending to the Oakland City Station. This area has been bolstered by Tyler Perry's studio's but has been neglected in spite of him generating hundreds of millions of dollars towards the state in revenue. They need to prioritize this area to have a new rail system rather than buses that provides innovation and a new desire to move/develop in this region. There are many families who use this station but there aren't great ways to access it aside from Uber or Lyft and a new light rail system would be a perfect addition to the area, especially due to covid. ;;5;5;;['Fort McPherson', 'Oakland City'];;['Increase Access to High-Capacity Transit', 'Improve Travel Times and Reliability', 'Promote Transit-Supportive Development'];['Ben Hill'];;;[];
