Box 233, Longville, LA  70652  The most sensible alternative is not presented and may not have been considered.  That alternative would add about 5 miles to the trip between Welsh and Vinton but it would completely bypass the urban/I-10 Bridge bottleneck that exists from Chloe to West Sulphur.    Here is a description of a practical flat route that would make it unnecessary to build a new bridge in the EDC-contaminated zone:    The “North Bypass” would take off to from just west of Welsh, go northwest about 9 miles to a cloverleaf at U.S. Highway 165 south of Fenton, then turn west, go along the existing high ground to avoid as much wetland disruption as possible, cross with only slightly-elevated bridges Bayou Serpent and the Calcasieu River, (a distance for this segment of about 11 miles), then proceed another 6 miles to a cloverleaf at U.S. Highway 171 south of Gillis, proceed westward another 5 miles to again, a low-level crossing of Hickory Branch and then go four miles to a cloverleaf at Louisiana State Highway 27 north of Sulphur, then turn southwesterly for about 15 miles to rejoin Interstate 10 just east of Vinton.    That is a 50 mile route, about 5 miles longer than the existing route between one end of the bottleneck to the other.  The enhancement of safety for motorists, the reduction in energy wastage on steep slopes and from stop and go situations all make a flat bypass north of the current route more logical than are the alternatives presented even given the extra 5 miles of travel required.    Furthermore, the route and the cloverleaves described above would simplify trips to and from places like Alexandria, Kinder, DeRidder, Houston, and New Orleans  by removing the need to navigate the Calcasieu metropolitan area.   A much more efficient highway system will also diminish greenhouse gases.

There is certainly demand for it and this would significantly enhance bike commuter mobility. Regarding the bike facilities in Question 11, I have two thoughts: \n1. It seems to me to be best to continue and expand upon the existing network, or at least keep future continuation in mind. Protected, two-way cycle tracks are great, but if its just a brief segment, and cyclists are forced back into the conventional bike lanes or into shared car lanes after a 1/2 mile, this creates extra conflict points at intersections, and it seems to make more sense to continue the conventional bike lanes. \n2. Thought needs to be put into the larger network! Atlanta typically installs bike infrastructure in tiny segments that dont connect. An ideal network would link destinations to existing infrastructure, i.e. the beltline and FP trail.\nThanks for reading!!!
