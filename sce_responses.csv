ALL, but again, they aren't on my daily routine. They're all way far west.;donotlive;;no-preference;"As I wrote above, when you said EAST, I got excited, thinking that maybe, just maybe, east OTP would get some better transit that could make car usage to shop intown less appealing, and improve transit for folks who routinely have to spend upwards of an hour one-way.  As it is, if I am going to walk almost a mile to the bus stop, wait for the bus to get to the train, wait for the train .... or even drive to Indian Creek, Kensington, or Avondale stations and take the train -- I can just drive intown.  Even knowing I will have to wrestle with parking is less hassle.  I would love to take MARTA more often; I have visited enough places in the world with functioning metros that actually were intended for traffic reduction among all social classes, not just relegated to those who had no other option, that I know how valuable they are.  In England I stayed with a friend at St. Alban's.  Within 3/10 of a mile (my measurement) there was a train station.  That whisked me right into London, and I could walk to the British Library to do my work every day.  I traveled all over San Francisco using BART, and never saw driving as more convenient, even though I had access to a car.  Car usage was about even-Steven with the metro in Portland or Seattle, but the metro was a viable option for almost anything.  But here in the south or southwest -- metro lines were primarily maid and working class lines, and it shows.  (I know the ATL ballooned in the 80s and 90s, so the current metro limits make some sense, and I know those eedjits up in Cobb and down in McDonough fought metro expansion very effectively---which makes current traffic unsustainable and makes me glad I chose to live east. Especially when that section of 85 collapsed a couple of years ago .... All the same, while I am very glad to see expansion, wht about REALLY coming East?  Even better, South east, which is massively underserved?  The rich folks in Kirkwood and intown already have options.) ";;;I was hoping that when you said east you actually meant EAST -- OTP.

By the time the bike lane starts at Jesse Hill, most cars have turned off at Piedmont, Courtland, or Bell street, and there isn't even that much traffic anymore. ;;;;['Impact to pedestrian/cyclist experience on the BeltLine trail', 'Construction  impacts (e.g., traffic, business access)', 'Loss of trees/tree canopy'];['Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street'];['Commuter'];['Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE', 'Irwin Street, between Sampson Street and Krog Street'];;;It's not clear how cyclists going westbound in the cycle track would transition to the opposite side of the street if continuing on West on Edgewood.;;;sometimes;;{'Near places with the highest number of jobs': '4', 'Near places with the greatest potential for redevelopment': '5', 'Near places with the highest number of residents (apartments, condominiums)': '1', 'Near places with the highest number of destinations (shopping, restaurants, services)': '2', 'Near places with a high number of community facilities (parks, churches, recreational)': '3'};;[{'x': -84.38497519885459, 'y': 33.7555793612688}, {'x': -84.38354998522296, 'y': 33.75556174097977}, {'x': -84.38020152851995, 'y': 33.75552650039086}, {'x': -84.37938560721693, 'y': 33.75553090600971}, {'x': -84.37659875898119, 'y': 33.75548685634434}, {'x': -84.37434172986265, 'y': 33.75551769133026}, {'x': -84.3744000096283, 'y': 33.75444726939602}, {'x': -84.37666763497859, 'y': 33.75441643348066}, {'x': -84.37549143688538, 'y': 33.75442964832986}, {'x': -84.37220655790014, 'y': 33.7543371427093}, {'x': -84.37302247953058, 'y': 33.754367978108725}, {'x': -84.373695349577, 'y': 33.754376787831916}, {'x': -84.37752594219079, 'y': 33.754469293954145}, {'x': -84.37997900437944, 'y': 33.754429648874314}, {'x': -84.38226782317543, 'y': 33.754478104211394}, {'x': -84.38227312112758, 'y': 33.754539774897744}, {'x': -84.38898778288574, 'y': 33.75683840876456, 'type': 'work'}, {'x': -84.34300928391995, 'y': 33.74463774424624, 'type': 'home'}, {'x': -84.36461266101904, 'y': 33.75754154540904, 'type': 'play'}];

Factoring in stops and waiting time I feel like that speed is more comparable to biking than a true modal alternative.
- Please push to get as much dedicated RoW for the street car. You and I both know that enforcement for parking in the street and other stuff will be poor/lax as it always is, so the only way to ensure the path is clear is to get the cars out of the way. Literally every other road in this city caters to cars, bikes, transit, and the vibrant businesses on Edgewood deserve a true street for people.
- Reconsider not choosing alignment alternative 2. It's better for everyone that will ride the streetcar one day, and only worse for a few people against progress. Doesn't seem fair to select a longer route, inconveniencing everyone, at the benefit of a very few.

;donotlive;;cycle-track;"1) I really really hope there's more conversation around the track couplet taking riders west on Auburn/east on Edgewood.  This would take so much pressure off of Edgewood and limit the inevitable bottlenecks that 2-way streetcar traffic would cause on the ALREADY congested street.  I feel as if having one-way streetcar on both Edgewood and Auburn would at least give MARTA the option to possibly bypass Edgewood on extremely busy nights when the streetcar would surely get stuck.  If it has to be 2-way on Edgewood, we HAVE to have options where Edgewood is closed to through vehicular traffic.  

2) I think there needs to be another stop around the Edgewood & Randolph intersection.  The distance from the Boulevard stop to the Irwin stop is already about twice as long as most of the other stop distances.  Adding a stop at the Randolph turn would make the streetcar even more attractive option for all the development on the Beltline at Edgewood so that they wouldn't be caught between 2 stations that are pretty far to walk to comfortably.";Not quite sure this would be the most effective stop location to get users. I'd like to see this stop closer to Irwin (see comment under 6G);"This placement concerns me as it seems like a ""far"" walk from the main intersection at Irwin.  I'd like to see this station placed just north of Irwin so it's visible from Krog St. Market, Irwin St and the Beltline - I think this would greatly enhance the existing node and get a lot more passersby interested in taking the streetcar.";Love it - perfect to catch the casual PCM visitors and Kroger development workers/residents;['Impact to pedestrian/cyclist experience on the BeltLine trail'];['Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street'];['Commuter', 'Employed'];['Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street'];Again I don't really like this stop here since it's not really visible and convenient to the Irwin intersection.

;morethanayear;Mixed traffic (e.g. allowing cars to drive on the tracks on Edgewood) would significantly slow the trains and could result in the system not being used.

It is what it is.

To improve safety and improve timeliness of the streetcar, all motor vehicle traffic from this section of Edgewood should be removed. There are plenty of parallel routes available for cars ( Auburn, Irwin, John Wesley Dobbs, Decatur St, Memorial, Freedom Parkway, etc). Removing the ""mixed traffic"" component of this section would create an attractive and safe ""transportation mall"" allowing quick transit times and full access of all businesses on Edgewood.
The cycle track here must be high quality in order to be successful. It must be wide, smoothly paved, well marked, and adequately blocked to prevent cars from parking or idling in it. It should also be accompanied by new bike racks along Edgewood Street.";A pedestrian crossing of the tracks is needed at Ralph McGill.

I'm ok with loosing parking and loading, part of this plan is to encourge street car use;donotlive;Handling the areas where the three modes of traffic meet and ensuring the street car only stops at a stop, just like heavy rail.;no-preference;;I might like the stop being on the beltline vs. Auburn ave, it puts your riders closer to the restaurants vs. in the neighborhood. This could be a heavily used stop, so plan for queuing and on/off solution. ;I think this is your biggest challenge, there are too many items colliding here already without the streetcar. Having a traffic light installed could help manage pedestrians, vehicles, and the streetcar. The light could be synced to the streetcar to clear the area so it does not have to stop, which I feel is important to get people to use it.  ;Great stop, would be used heavily, should consider a queuing solution and on/off solution. ;['other'];['I do not support partial closures of existing streets to vehicular traffic', 'other'];['Commuter'];['Irwin Street, between Sampson Street and Krog Street', 'other'];I don't have any issues with the bike lanes or the stop, though I'd assume the residents there would perfer the stop on the beltline, which I think long term would make more sense. ;Certainly, on Edgewood you have to give the streetcar priority in order to make it successful and not sitting in traffic. Timing the lights when the street car is coming would likely suffice vs. closing streets. From Irwin to the beltline, this is already a very congested area already so something needs to be done to minimize vehicle traffic for the street car, bike, and pedestrians.;I like the dedicated lane here, but you have to police cars and vans from not parking in the bike lanes as they do in other parts of the city (downtown) for deliveries and even cabs. I use to live downtown and the bike lanes on Peachtree Center Ave and John Portman constently had vehicles parked in them.  ;Seems to make sense, looks good;I don't believe Auburn Ave is as busy as Edgewood, so that might be better to keep bikes there and the streetcar with traffic on Edgewood. ;sometimes;This stop makes sense, though at the skate park you might need fencing or netting to keep Frisbees, footballs, soccer balls, etc. from getting onto the tracks, especially if since you're adding a barrier.  ;{'Near places with the highest number of jobs': '3', 'Near places with the greatest potential for redevelopment': '5', 'Near places with the highest number of residents (apartments, condominiums)': '4', 'Near places with the highest number of destinations (shopping, restaurants, services)': '1', 'Near places with a high number of community facilities (parks, churches, recreational)': '2'};;[{'x': -84.36492253992607, 'y': 33.757555747710754}, {'x': -84.36428082141931, 'y': 33.75752397050751}, {'x': -84.35959232006188, 'y': 33.76537313925939}, {'x': -84.36453831348409, 'y': 33.77261068450054}, {'x': -84.37213928459268, 'y': 33.75430111325773}, {'x': -84.37213928459275, 'y': 33.75549641891799}, {'x': -84.36799795387414, 'y': 33.7543122635741}, {'x': -84.36400549492642, 'y': 33.756848131234115, 'type': 'meet'}];
;morethanayear;I am concerned that the streecar's current failings (primarily running in traffic vs. having its own right-of-way/priority) will be extended to the trail, also that the area it currently DOES run in traffic will be a bottleneck for the entire system. Also concerned about the pedestrian/cyclist experience but that's a runner up. Gotta get the transit part right if you're going to build it. Finally, I'm a car owner and live right next to I-20, but please close every street to traffic and remove all the on-street parking if it will make the transit work better.;couplet;;Just make sure track crossing access here is sufficient for the amount of foot/LIT traffic this spot will surely get.;Let's close Auburn (between Randolph and Irwin) and this short stretch of Irwin to car traffic, please.

West of Boulevard it's a disaster and I just take the lane. Also, honestly, Edgewood should really be closed to car traffic or at least given dedicated right-of-way for the entire distance it runs on-street. (It's not difficult - the venerable St. Charles Streetcar in New Orleans runs in the median for most of its length.)

Another option is from Hilliard to Boulevard is that it could just be a ped plaza that keeps cars out and no designated bike lanes are given as cyclists and pedestrians will have the entire space to use unless a street car is coming and needs the space.

;morethanayear;This project is so unreliable that I continue to not use it due to traffic. I currently never use the current streetcar because it is so unpredictable. Why should 100 people on a train wait on 5 people in personal vehicles?;cycle-track;"1. Trust. The biggest reason I never use the streetcar today despite living within a 10 minute walk is the embarrassing headways and inconsistency. Why would anyone use transit they can't trust? Will MARTA extend streetcar hours to match heavy rail? Will the streetcar continue to suspend service during major events? Will the streetcar continue to get delayed by personal vehicles?
2. We need dedicated ROW or, at a minimum, signal priority. And not just the kind that holds a green light or shortens a red light, I want it to turn green for the streetcar automatically.
3. Edgewood should be closed to personal vehicles. Otherwise the streetcar will be unable to maintain a schedule.
4. The streetcar needs to run as late as MARTA heavy rail and weekend service should mirror weekday.
5. I like the current number of stations. Any more would slow things down too much.
6. I would prefer to see the base of the track on the beltline to be grass.

;donotlive;prioritizing the streetcar in the on-street segments/providing dedicated ROW for the streetcar!;cycle-track;"Possibly out of scope, but I'd love to see a cycle track ::ON:: the beltline itself! There is certainly demand for it and this would significantly enhance bike commuter mobility. Regarding the bike facilities in Question 11, I have two thoughts: 
1. It seems to me to be best to continue and expand upon the existing network, or at least keep future continuation in mind. Protected, two-way cycle tracks are great, but if it's just a brief segment, and cyclists are forced back into the conventional bike lanes or into shared car lanes after a 1/2 mile, this creates extra conflict points at intersections, and it seems to make more sense to continue the conventional bike lanes. 
2. Thought needs to be put into the larger network! Atlanta typically installs bike infrastructure in tiny segments that don't connect. An ideal network would link destinations to existing infrastructure, i.e. the beltline and FP trail.

As the current system is, it's unreliable and inefficient because it's subject to the cars and trucks on the road (and on its tracks).;;;;['Loss of trees/tree canopy', 'other'];['Irwin Street, between Sampson Street and Krog Street', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street'];['Employed'];['other'];;I support full closure of sections of existing streets to vehicular traffic.;;;;everyday;;{'Near places with the highest number of jobs': '3', 'Near places with the greatest potential for redevelopment': '4', 'Near places with the highest number of residents (apartments, condominiums)': '5', 'Near places with the highest number of destinations (shopping, restaurants, services)': '1', 'Near places with a high number of community facilities (parks, churches, recreational)': '2'};;[{'x': -84.37952106859443, 'y': 33.7497780518472}, {'x': -84.37663715693778, 'y': 33.75026333700197}, {'x': -84.37471455003977, 'y': 33.75054879808722}, {'x': -84.37358158390413, 'y': 33.75086280483675}, {'x': -84.3711783246268, 'y': 33.751776270796015}, {'x': -84.37021702248747, 'y': 33.75191899893906}, {'x': -84.36966770398574, 'y': 33.75211881706903}, {'x': -84.36887806322336, 'y': 33.752375726964644}, {'x': -84.3676077674623, 'y': 33.752803907687436}, {'x': -84.36623447644669, 'y': 33.753317721514435}, {'x': -84.37928073978543, 'y': 33.75437388537655}, {'x': -84.37952106859443, 'y': 33.75557275828871}, {'x': -84.37797611620186, 'y': 33.75548712475414}, {'x': -84.37797611620186, 'y': 33.75437388537655}, {'x': -84.3767058204408, 'y': 33.75440242972378}, {'x': -84.37550419080213, 'y': 33.75440242972378}, {'x': -84.37443989078889, 'y': 33.75437388537655}, {'x': -84.37217396113698, 'y': 33.754345341019814}, {'x': -84.37663715693778, 'y': 33.75551566927516}, {'x': -84.37557285692452, 'y': 33.755544212697814}, {'x': -84.37440555903736, 'y': 33.75551566927516}, {'x': -84.37213962938547, 'y': 33.75551566927516}, {'x': -84.37165897700612, 'y': 33.75300372484408}, {'x': -84.37581318180452, 'y': 33.75032756621014, 'type': 'meet'}, {'x': -84.36424320604563, 'y': 33.75463792376472, 'type': 'play'}, {'x': -84.38439625196185, 'y': 33.77025045330821, 'type': 'home'}, {'x': -84.38800113956822, 'y': 33.7743600437962, 'type': 'work'}];
